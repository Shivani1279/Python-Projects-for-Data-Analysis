# Python-Projects-for-Data-Analysis
In this repository, I have added all my Python projects for data analysis. Through these projects I intend to showcase my knowledge about various libraries used for EDA and the importance of EDA.
My first project is Demand and Supply Analysis. The demand for a product or service is the quantity of that product or service the customers are willing to purchase at any given price during a particular period. And the supply for a product or service is the quantity the producers are willing to provide in the market at a particular price and a particular period.
Demand and Supply analysis means analyzing the relationship between the quantity demanded and the quantity supplied. It helps businesses understand the factors influencing consumer demand to maximize profits.
My second project is Recession Analysis. A recession is an economic situation that arrives when the circulation of money in the economy is low for two consecutive quarters. When the circulation of money is low, it means people are not spending money in the market. When people donâ€™t spend money, businesses face losses, which results in an economic slowdown and layoffs, which you must have already heard about in 2023.
